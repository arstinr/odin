        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sinigang is a sour soup native to the Philippines. This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. Other proteins and seafood can also be used. Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang. The chicken version, on the other hand, is called sinampalukang manok. I prefer to use either pork belly or buto-buto when cooking sinigang. The latter refers to cuts with bones intact. These are either pork neck bones, chopped spare ribs, and chopped baby back ribs. Pork shoulder and ham can also be used when cooking sinigang.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>I usually use packaged tamarind mixes as the fresh fruit is not always available in my area. Although these powder flavorings are easy and convenient to use, nothing beats pork sinigang from scratch! Just follow the steps below on how to use green tamarind pods.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash tamarind pods under cold, running water to remove any grit or dirt from the skins.</li>
            <li>Place in a saucepan with about 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 4 to 5 minutes until soft, and the outer skins begin to burst.</li>
            <li>Using a fork, mash the tamarinds to release the pulp.</li>
            <li>Place the tamarind and liquid in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice to fully extract the juice.</li>
            <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot.</li>
        </ol>
